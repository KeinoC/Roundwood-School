        Background: You are a student with only one shot! You have put your entire life savings on this bootcamp and you are in major debt through the mob. You have 1 year to pay back and you decide Roundwood is your best chance at getting a job that will help you pay back your debt or youâ€™ll be sleeping with the fishes. 

What we need: 
    Mental health data, 
    Programming data (Frontend and Backend), 
    Characters (Always choose your own name, avatar, and class), 
    Records, 
    Characters Stats and Classes (Keino, Tyler, Eleanor, Gehrig, Nick). Indicate Classes by colors , 
    Chance Cards (Logic: Math.random from 1-100. The number generated will determine your choices based on your difficulty. Harder classes will have lower ranges for better options.)

Open Deliverables
    1. continue keeps looping tutorial stories.
    2. how to hide and show messages when a button is clicked
    3. make display & hid functions
    - I think the high score needs to be outside of the #homepage view and body needs to be set to something like inline-block. this should push the high score comfortable to the right of the game view that way it's not pushed down depending on the size of the divs in game view.
